## Quick Review of the Bot and Generation Process

Here is the process of generating audio and video in the Telegram bot
that I host locally on my machine with a 5060ti GPU and 32 gigabytes of RAM.

I do it for fun, some pieces are production ready but
most of the code was written for learning purposes.

For this generation, I want to create a video of Heisenberg from Breaking Bad saying the famous quote
"I am the one who knocks."

<CdnMedia
  type="video"
  src="local_comfyui_infinitetalk_indextts_telegram_bot_post/i+am+the+one+who+Toks+%23breakingbad+%5B7188179653578771718%5D.webm"
  alt="Heisenberg from Breaking Bad"
  width="400"
/>

First of all, I initiate the command to generate audio or video.
The bot returns options to choose from.
We can choose audio first, because later we will use it to generate video from it.

We provide the text prompt to be converted to speech and a reference voice.

<CdnMedia
  type="audio"
  src="local_comfyui_infinitetalk_indextts_telegram_bot_post/Haisenberg+part+10+seconds.mp3"
/>

After only one minute, we get the audio file.

<CdnMedia
  type="audio"
  src="local_comfyui_infinitetalk_indextts_telegram_bot_post/8cd09b39-a9d3-45a0-a38e-d1174edc6540.wav"
/>

Then we generate the video.

<CdnMedia
  type="image"
  src="local_comfyui_infinitetalk_indextts_telegram_bot_post/video_generation.webp"
  width="400"
/>

We provide a text prompt describing the scene we want to generate.
Since we use InfiniteTalk, we describe the person who speaks directly to the camera.
We send an image that will be used as the first frame
and the generated audio file that we created before.

After around three or four minutes, we get the video file.

<CdnMedia
  type="video"
  src="local_comfyui_infinitetalk_indextts_telegram_bot_post/InfiniTalk_1c578020a4844f28ae2e5875bb5430f9_00001-audio.webm"
  alt="Heisenberg from Breaking Bad"
  width="400"
/>

As you can see, it's cropped to square format and has low resolution
because I don't want to wait for generation and don't have enough GPU power to generate high-quality video quickly,
but still, the result is quite good for fun purposes.

Another thing that I want to mention is that doing voice cloning
and applying it to images of prominent people could be banned in services
such as ElevenLabs, Gemini, or Sora.
You don't know for sure whether your generation will succeed or fail.
For the first generations, you might get lucky and get the result you want,
but later the service might block you. That's why when you host everything locally or
rent dedicated hardware, you have full control over what you generate
and you don't have to worry about bans or restrictions.

Okay, let's continue with Jesse Pinkman now.
We do everything the same way as with Heisenberg,
and here is the result.

<CdnMedia
  type="video"
  src="local_comfyui_infinitetalk_indextts_telegram_bot_post/InfiniTalk_2d1c296f03d343809dd6777903a790ff_00001-audio.webm"
  alt="Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad"
  width="400"
/>

As you can see, the result is quite good for fun purposes as well.

So in conclusion, what you can do with this setup is generate fun videos of your favorite characters
saying whatever you want them to say,
and you have full control over the generation process.
Just keep in mind that the quality of the generation depends on your hardware capabilities
and the models you use for generation.
